Description: Zencontent is a minimalist single column theme, designed to better serve old-school bloggers who want to share content in a lightweight and uncluttered way. It supports dark mode, post formats and Gutenberg blocks. For developers, Zencontent is also easy to customize and extend, as it was developed using only Tailwind CSS and Typescript - give it a try!
